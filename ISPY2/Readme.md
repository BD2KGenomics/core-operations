ISPY2

The ISPY2 project is based at UCSF.  Our primary contact is Laura van't Veer
and her group (Denise Wolf, Melissa Cline).  

ISPY2 is a multi-arm clinical trial for breast cancer, involving precision
medicine approaches to predicting which drug a patient will benefit from given
her genomic data, (most frequently) assigning that patient to take that drug as
well as receing the standard of care, and determining if that approch is more
effective than the standard of care alone.
