PNOC samples are stored at 
amazon aws s3://cbttc.seq.data/pnoc/

We received a table, PNOC_sample_summary.xlsx, that contains information on sample names and fastq locations.
There are two tabs: feasibility_data and trial_data. These were saved as text files
feasibility_data.txt
trial_data.txt

The program parse_PNOC_table.py reads these tables and performs the following steps:

- Create a sample UUID that consists of the first part of the fastq names that belong to the sample
- Group samples by tumor DNA (tumor_WXS), control (Constitutional) DNA(control_WXS), and Tumor RNA (RNASeq)
- Download all files for a sample and decrypt them
- Concatenate all fastq.gz R1 files for a single group
- Concatenate all fastq.gz R2 files for a single group
- Encrypt the files
- Upload these files to https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cgl-driver-projects-encrypted/treehouse/pnoc-samples
- Output a config list of UUIDs and corresponding fastq.gz files

# all of this happens behind the a firewall (on a toil cluster machine) to ensure security.

where
C021_0001_20140916 is the sample UUID
tumor_WXS refers to tumor DNA (tumor exome)

# Our RNASeq pipeline requires tar files that contain these fastq.gz files in such a way that they untar in the same directory
# To create:

# feasibility.config contains the UUID, fastq_R1.gz, fastq_R2.gz from the feasibility study

grep 'RNASeq' feasibility.config > feasibility.rnaseq
./s3fastqToTar.py -c feasibility.rnaseq > pnoc.rnaseq.config

grep 'RNASeq' trial.config > trial.rnaseq
